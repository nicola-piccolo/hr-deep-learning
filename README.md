## About Real Estate Machine Learning project

I wanted to experiment Machine Learning and Python/Flask a little bit, so I came up with this project to be used as a template for other toy project.

I have then built a simple "Hello World" REST API Flask application server and I have also provided a minimum configuration for Docker, in case I need to run the project in a network of Docker containers.

### Built With

* Python 3.6
* Flask 1.1
* Gunicorn 20.0
* Docker 20.10
